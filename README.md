# Yelp_Rating_Regression_Predictor

Project: Yelp Rating Regression Predictor
In this project, we will use real data from Yelp to predict the Yelp rating of a restaurant.

With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp rating we are going to use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating and predict the Yelp rating for your restaurant!

There is a list of files provided by Yelp: 

 1. yelp_business.json: establishment data regarding location and attributes for all businesses in the dataset

2. yelp_review.json: Yelp review metadata by business

3. yelp_user.json: user profile metadata by business

4. yelp_checkin.json: online checkin metadata by business

5. yelp_tip.json: tip metadata by business
6. yelp_photo.json: photo metadata by business
