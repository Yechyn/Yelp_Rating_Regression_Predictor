# Yelp_Rating_Regression_Predictor

Project: Yelp Rating Regression Predictor
In this project we'll be working with a real dataset provided by Yelp. There are six files, listed below with a brief description:

yelp_business.json: establishment data regarding location and attributes for all businesses in the dataset
yelp_review.json: Yelp review metadata by business
yelp_user.json: user profile metadata by business
yelp_checkin.json: online checkin metadata by business
yelp_tip.json: tip metadata by business
yelp_photo.json: photo metadata by business

The goad is to predict a restaurant's Yelp rating based on the data.
